# Online Event Management System


This abstract presents a comprehensive overview of the project titled 

"Online Event management system" which seeks to address the existing 

operational challenges faced by Kaaf Events, a traditional offline event 

management and catering group. The Online Event management system enables 

customers/ clients to view various packages about the event and make bookings 

through the online platform. It can help the customer with all of these details. It 

will work with choosing the right venue, setting the date and time, and planning 

the activities. The user gets all the resources at a single place instead of wandering 

around for these. This system is effective and saves time for the users. Eliminate 

the paperwork.

 The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as 

event planning and it included catering, venue, videography and photography of 

the event, arranging decor, choosing themes for the event etc. An event manager 

can improve the productivity of event by using this system. No formal knowledge 

is needed for the user to use this system. Thus, by this all it proves it is user-

friendly.

 The present working system of most companies is manual, there is a lot 

of paperwork. It is difficult to maintain all the details of events, customers and 

services. The manually handled system is time consuming. This proposed system 

everything is web-based. This will immediately reduce the manual processing, 

thereby increasing the speed of the event management process. There are various 

functions and modules in the system to perform various features. These overall 

increases management productivity, eliminate paperwork and prove to be very 

economical in the long run.
